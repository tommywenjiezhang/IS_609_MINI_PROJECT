## What is a repository
A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history.
## How to clone respository
type the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/tommywenjiezhang/IS_609_MINI_PROJECT.git
```
##Fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
###Steps to Fork:
- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.
##Branch
Branch allows for parallel work. New development (such as features and non-emergency bug fixes) is done in feature branches, and is only merged back into main body of code when the developer(s) is happy that the code is ready for release.
###How to create a new Branch 
## How to fetch your respository
```
